# Loaner-Request-App-ServiceNow
This is a custom ServiceNow application built using Studio to manage loaner equipment requests like laptops, phones, and other assets. Developed as part of a course lab, it streamlines request handling and improves visibility and automation.
Key Features:
1. Scoped App built in ServiceNow Studio
2. Role-based workflows (ESS User, Requestor, Fulfiller, Approver)
3. Automated email notifications:
  ** Ready for Pickup
  ** Return Reminders
  ** Overdue Alerts
4. Scheduled scripts and business rules for daily checks
5. Service Catalog integration for user submissions
6. Request lifecycle tracking with custom states and approvals

Note: This repository includes ServiceNow update sets corresponding to each module of the Loaner Request Management application. These update sets can be imported into a ServiceNow instance to replicate the application and its configurations as developed in the lab environment.
